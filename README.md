# pregame-helper

The goal of this project was to create an application utilizing Java and JavaFX to help automate and speed up the process of block setting for pregame for the University of Minnesota Marching Band trumpet section. It is currently abandoned as we decided to utilize a heavily scripted google spreadsheet instead.
